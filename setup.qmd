# Let's get started

To conduct this training you will need to install some tools:

  1. [Download and install R](https://cran.r-project.org)
  2. Download and install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in general we use [R studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), but feel free to use the IDE that you prefer. Other interesting IDEs might be: [Positron](https://positron.posit.co) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
  3. Make sure you have the required packages installed:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install(c(
  "CDMConnector", "CodelistGenerator", "duckdb", "DrugUtilisation", 
  "DrugExposureDiagnostics", "CohortConstructor", "omock", "ggplot2", 
  "visOmopResults", "gt"
))
```
  
You are all set :)
